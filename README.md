# CS-1331-Grade-Calculator
 Grade calculator for Professor Aibek Musaev's CS 1331 class at Georgia Tech.

 The project is in its first version and, thus, is rather simple. In order to use the website, input your scores and calculate using the button below.
 The button will show your grade in the class currently, and what final exam scores are needed in order to meet certain grade thresholds.
 User input is constantly validated to ensure scores inputted are between 0 and the max amount of points alloted, and are integers or doubles.
 Project is built using basic JS and HTML.
